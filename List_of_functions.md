    The vararg MethodRationalSplittingField can be either "Pari" or "Magma" and decides whether the computation of the splitting field and the roots is outsourced to Pari or not.
    Recall that a CMType PHI satisfies RRC if:

        2) the associated reflex field has residue field that can be realized as a subfield of the field of definition of AVh.
    We build create Q and Qp-splitting field of the Weil polynomil and hence a bijection between complex and p-adic roots. 
    This allow us to do the tests in the p-adic splitting field, increasing speed.
    The intermediate data is recorded in the attribute RRC_data. See above for a detailed description.*
